# /github tasks

Lists all available tasks that can be claimed by swarms, sorted by priority.

## Usage

```
/github tasks [options]
```

## Options

- `--priority <level>` - Filter by priority (critical, high, medium, low)
- `--area <component>` - Filter by area (core, mcp, neural, wasm, docs)
- `--type <type>` - Filter by type (bug, feature, task, enhancement)
- `--limit <number>` - Limit results (default: 20)

## Examples

```
/github tasks                    # All available tasks
/github tasks --priority high    # Only high priority tasks
/github tasks --area neural      # Neural network related tasks
/github tasks --type bug         # Only bug fixes
```

## Implementation

Uses GitHub MCP to:
1. Query issues with `available` label
2. Exclude issues with `swarm-claimed` label
3. Sort by priority and creation date
4. Format for easy reading
