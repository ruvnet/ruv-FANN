Subject: Request for Independent Verification - Multi-Agent System SWE-Bench Results

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out to researchers with expertise in multi-agent systems and benchmark evaluation.

I've been developing a cognitive diversity framework for coding tasks and obtained results that frankly seem implausible:

• 84.8% solve rate on SWE-Bench Verified (current SOTA: 70.3%)
• 27+ specialized neural models (LSTM, TCN, N-BEATS, etc.)
• 4.4x execution speedup through WASM deployment
• 99.5% multi-agent coordination accuracy

Given these results exceed current benchmarks by a significant margin, I'm seeking independent verification before drawing any conclusions.

I've prepared a comprehensive verification package:
- GitHub: github.com/ruv-fann/ruv-swarm-verification
- Technical guide: [see below]
- Docker environment for easy reproduction
- Time required: 30 mins (quick) or 2-3 hours (full)

Would you or your colleagues be interested in providing independent validation? I'm particularly looking for expertise in:
- SWE-Bench evaluation methodology
- Multi-agent system architectures
- Neural ensemble performance analysis
- WebAssembly optimization

I suspect there may be measurement errors or methodological issues I'm missing. Any help identifying problems or confirming results would be invaluable.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. The technical verification guide below provides detailed procedures and specific validation points.

def analyze_cognitive_diversity():
    models = load_ensemble_config()
    
    # Check architectural diversity
    unique_architectures = count_unique_architectures(models)
    assert unique_architectures >= 27

### 📊 Critical Validation Points

#### Benchmark Methodology
- [ ] Correct SWE-Bench version (Verified set, 500 instances)
- [ ] No preprocessing of test instances
- [ ] Standard evaluation timeout (300s)
- [ ] Official solve rate calculation method
- [ ] Proper handling of partial solutions

#### Multi-Agent Claims
- [ ] True architectural diversity (not just hyperparameter variations)
- [ ] Coordination measured on realistic tasks
- [ ] Byzantine fault tolerance actually implemented
- [ ] Swarm size constraints respected (5-7 agents per phase)
- [ ] No hidden centralized coordination

#### Performance Metrics
- [ ] WASM speedup consistent across hardware platforms
- [ ] Token counting methodology matches official standards
- [ ] Memory usage within reasonable bounds
- [ ] No hidden preprocessing or caching costs
- [ ] Fair comparison with baseline systems

#### Statistical Rigor
- [ ] Confidence intervals properly calculated
- [ ] Multiple runs for stability verification
- [ ] No cherry-picking of favorable results
- [ ] Appropriate statistical tests applied
- [ ] Comparison with all relevant baselines

### 🚨 Common Issues to Check

1. **Data Leakage**: Models may have seen test instances during training
2. **Measurement Error**: Incorrect timing, token counting, or success criteria
3. **Coordination Inflation**: Testing only on trivially parallelizable tasks
4. **Architecture Confusion**: Counting minor variations as unique models
5. **Caching Effects**: Unfair advantage through result caching
6. **Hardware Specificity**: Results only valid on specific hardware
7. **Timeout Manipulation**: Different timeout settings than baseline

### 📊 Expected Findings

#### If Claims Are Valid
- Consistent 84-85% solve rate across multiple runs
- WASM speedup of 3.5-5x depending on hardware
- High coordination accuracy (>99%) in controlled tests
- Clear evidence of model specialization
- Statistically significant improvement over baselines

#### If Issues Exist
- Inconsistent results across runs
- Performance degradation on unseen instances
- Coordination accuracy drops on complex tasks
- Models show high correlation (not truly diverse)
- Statistical tests fail significance thresholds
