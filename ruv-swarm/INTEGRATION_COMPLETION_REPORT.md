## âœ… Issue #106: Init Command Path Resolution Bug
**Status**: FIXED

### Bug Fix
Fixed hardcoded path `/workspaces/claude-code-flow` in `src/cli/simple-cli.ts`

### Solution
Implemented dynamic path resolution with 4-tier fallback:
1. Development source directory
2. Current working directory
3. Bin directory
4. Node modules directory

### Results
- All 18 SPARC files copy correctly
- Works in all environments
- Graceful error handling
